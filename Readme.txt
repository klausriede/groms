The GROMS integrates information from a wide variety of sources, including digital data sets (see Table 
4.1 on information sources, RIEDE 2001, p. 45, ). Data owners have permitted publication of their data on the GROMS CD, but any re-distribution of these data has to be dealt with the original data owners. The GROMS does not guarantee for correctness, in particular due to errors from digital transfer. Citation of GROMS information should always include the original data source, e.g.: "Distribution map of the European sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, as digitised by GROMS (Riede 2001), after DEL HOYO et al. 1994."

All digital maps contain source information within the attribute table. Legislative and threat information 
might change rapidly, and should be checked within the respective online databases (e.g. International 
Red List: http://www.redlist.org, CITES: http://www.cites.org )
